# TheBridge

This in an ongoing university project, with the aim to build a mobile app using Ionic, Firebase and AngularFire. It is focused on helping the elderly and building local communities.
I do not take credit for all the code being my own, however it has been adjusted compared to the original code. I will soon upload all the links and resources used to create this project as well as comment the code in more depth.
